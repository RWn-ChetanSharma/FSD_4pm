    <h1>Variables In JS</h1>

      A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a
      sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.
    </p>

      store reusable values. A variable is a container for a value, like a
      number we might use in a sum,

      JavaScript variables must have unique names. These names are called
      Identifiers.
