      // Intoduction To JavaScript

      // JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website.
      // It was invented by Brendan Eich.

      // JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

      // The programs in this language are called scripts.
      // They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

      // Scripts are provided and executed as plain text.
      // They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

      // JavaScript is a lightweight language.
      // JavaScript is a cross-platform language.
      // JavaScript is a single-threaded language.
      // JavaScript is a interpreted compiled programming language.
      // It is also known as the scripting language for webpages
      // JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed).
      // JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.

      // Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server,
      // or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

      // The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

      // Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

      // V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
      // SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
      // There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
      // “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.

      // History of JavaScript

      // It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape.
      // It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed
