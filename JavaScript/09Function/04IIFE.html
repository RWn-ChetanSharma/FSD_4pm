    <h1>IIFE Function</h1>
    <p>
      An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function
      that runs as soon as it is defined.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within
        the Grouping Operator (). This prevents accessing variables within the
        IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression ()
        through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the
        function.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <script>
      // IIFE Function

      (function greet() {
        console.log("Namaste Bharat");
      })();
    </script>
  </body>
