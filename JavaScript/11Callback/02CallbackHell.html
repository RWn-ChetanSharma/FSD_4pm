    <h1>Callback Hell</h1>
    <p>
      Callback hell is a phenomenon where a Callback is called inside another
      Callback. It is the nesting of multiple Callbacks inside a function. If
      you look at the design of the code, it seems just like a pyramid. Thus the
      Callback hell is also referred to as the 'Pyramid of Doom'.

      //   Pyramid of DOOM =>

      //   In computer programming, the pyramid of doom is a common problem that arises
      //      when a program uses many levels of nested indentation to control access to a function.
      //          It is commonly seen when checking for null pointers or handling callbacks.
